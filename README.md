### Web3Locker

With Web3Locker, our goal is to address the shortcomings of traditional document storage and sharing systems. The current systems rely on centralized servers for storing important documents, which can lead to server overload and privacy breaches. Through the use of decentralized user accounts and Blockchain Technology, Web3Locker ensures proper data storage, reduces time wastage in storage and retrieval of data, and promotes individual privacy. Each user has their own decentralized account, which allows them to store and share their documents securely and independently.

## The problem Web3Locker solves

We aim for the practical implementation of a DAPP for managing and storing files and documents as well as securing the identity of individuals with the help of verification and applying the zero knowledge concept. With the integration of Unstoppable Domains and the Arcana Network, we were able to handle logins and store data with ease.

The existing system provided centralised based solution for keeping important documents of people, but privacy breaches are part of it. The security of the user privacy and user data was a major problem. These issues are solved by providing a decentralised user account to every individual by using Blockchain Technology.

Integrating the storage solution of the Arcana Network allows us to manage and have access control, i.e. for our dApp we can fully control access to the data we uploaded and transfer data ownership, powered by Arcana blockchain transactions. Furthermore, we can build user data privacy, availability, and security by allowing users to store and retrieve data using Arcana Store.

Unstoppable Domains gives us many options and the ones that we were able to realize in our project are Universal logins where authentication of users for login and communication facilities is easy if they have an account on associated Web3 platforms. We can transfer, update, and link your domain to other services with or without Unstoppable Domains.

Polygon ID provides us zero-knowledge native protocols and tools for ensuring a strong level of user privacy. It also gives us scalability options and gives the option of on-chain verification.

Example Use Case: A university can issue graduation degree claims to the students. The university will first generate a schema and a claim which would be converted into a QR code which would be present on the degree. Then that particular degree can be uploaded &. shared with respective student using Arcana Network. And Polygon ID app can be used to check the authenticity of the degree.
